 This notebook presents implementation and experiments of the algorithm suggested in the paper “Importance Weighted Autoencoders” by Yuri Buda, Roger Grosse & Ruslan Salakhutdinov.
 The main purpose of their paper is to provide an improvement to the original algorithm presented by Kingma & Welling (2014) in their paper “Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes”.
